            <h1 class="title"><b>THEME 02</b></h1>

            <h1>Basic Content</h1>

            <p> In Theme 02 we learned mostly about The basic principles behind composing a picture frame for moving images and how different content types fits into an online context. </p>
                <p>We worked with video and how to develop it in iterative steps using treatment and storyboard to professionalise the production.</p>

            <p> We produced 2 short videos. One on mobile, where we Created a story without using spoken language. And the other one a bit more professional using actual video cameras where the goal was creating an informative video for an external collaboration partner.</p>

            <h2><a class="spotify" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/19669cd4-c0d7-41bb-5c1c-f3f108a50ee5-6f57/" target="_blank">02.01.02 XD prototype </a></h2>

            <p> In this task we were introduced to Adobe XD. We made an <b>XD prototype</b> of our own responsive "information" website which would include an information video, information about the group members and creators of the website, as well as some extra information related to the external collaboration partner we were given. By the end of this theme the skeleton of the website would be mostly completed.</p>

            <p>Here I had to create a story without a spoken language. It was challenging but very rewarding once I completed the task. I learned how to use Adobe Premiere Pro for the first time which improved my Video cutting skills greatly, and I have used it alot in my own free time since. </p>

              <p>In these two tasks we had to come up with a story which had to include some additional information about biking in Copenhagen. It was challenging but we were a good group working closely together and had a lot of fun while doing it. My imagination was challenged and a lot of ideas were written on paper but eventually we came down to a united decision. </p>

            <p>Creating the website was a bit hard because, to be honest, we did not organize our given time, very well. Too much time was used in creating the video and creating the actual website got left behind. But we did our best with what we had and a rough responsive structure of how the website was supposed to look like was made. </p><br>



             <p> I learned alot during this theme and it was one of my favorite. Creating a story without words was challenging and I learned how you can use sound and moving images to create a decent story.</p>
            <p>My Video cutting and design skills overall were improved greatly as well as alot of other skills. </p>
