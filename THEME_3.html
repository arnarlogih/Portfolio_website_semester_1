            <h1>Basic Animation</h1>

            <p> In Theme 03 We worked a lot with Adobe Illustrator and Javascript. This Theme was my favourite but also, by far, the most challenging in my opinion. </p>
            <p>
                We worked a lot in groups but we also had some individual assignements. I can honestly say that I surprised myself a lot, going from such little knowlidge of Javascript into making an actual animation with it.

            <p> In this Task we were asked to make a character (eather created from scratch or something from the internet) do all kinds of stuff by using Javascript. I found myself a small animated Robot and by using Javascript I was able to make it jump around, lie down, Jump in circles, glow and all kinds of animation. It was very challenging and very frustrating if I was doing it wrong without knowing what it was that was wrong. But once I was able to make it work it was EXTREMELY REWARDING.</p>

            <p>For Example. Making the Robot jump in circle I had to do the following functions:</p>
            <p>HTML</p>

            <p>In these 2 tasks we were introduced to Storytelling and Character design.</p>
            <p> We had to create our own stroy as well as our own characters. This was very fun to do. I learned a lot about creating and designing something from scratch. For example, creating a character you have to know his back story. What makes him look and act like he does. </p>

            </figure>

            <p> Not only did we have to create characters but we had to aim the creation to a theme. "What kind of theme of animation are you using." I used flat design which is a bit more 2D-ish and what characterizes that theme is that is has no outside lines for example.</p>

            <p>The second task was creating an animated part of the story by using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This was a bit challenging. Making a sprite from the character to make him walk realisticly and then implementing it into the animation was very challenging, but really cool once it worked! </p>

            <p>These 2 tasks were a bit challenging but it helped having another person doing it as well since this was a group work. A lot of Javascript was used to make it work. </p>

            <p> This task was a lot of fun. Creating an actual working animated story with Javascript. I was lucky that this was a group work with approx. 6 members. Otherwise I never would have finished it in time on my own. I was mostly creating the characters and background in Illustrator while other ones worked on Javascript. </p>

            <p>Creating Characters was one of my favourites, and I improved greatly using Illustrator in these tasks. </p>
