            <h1>Basic UX</h1>


            <p> In Theme 04 we were given a basic understanding of how interaction between users and user interfaces works, as well as experiencing it on our own. We also learned which theories, tools and methods we can use for researcg, design, testing and production of digital solutions for smartphones so that our work is based on specific insights about actual users instead of our own feeling and assumptions.</p>

            <p>This theme was mostly group work. We were gonna build and test a realistic protoype in 5 days.</p>

            <p>In this task we worked in groups coming up with a decision on how we could improve Fronter. Many ideas were written down and alot of discussions back and forth. Finally we had a vision on what we could aim on.</p>

            <p>I learned a lot more how Adobe XD works in this task. I had never really gotten my hands on it properly, but I think I have really improved using it and knowing how it works. </p>

            <p>After each member created his/her own XD prototype, we all looked at each others prototype and discussed what and how the final web prototype would look like. We came to a decision. and each member created a web prototype related to one members XD prototype </p>

            <h2><a class="spotify" href="http://arnarlogih.com/KEA/Fronterprototype/" target="_blank">04.03.01. Web prototype </a></h2>

            <p>This task was fun but a little challenging. Although creating a web prototype based on an XD Prototype was a lot easier than having to create it without no groundwork. So all the work we did before hand really paid off.</p>

            <p>I learned more and more how HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT works. As well as how rows work. Splitting the website in each section and so on. </p>

Theme documentation </a></h2>

            <p>These 2 tasks were related to the last ones but a bit more advanced. Instead of creating something that could be helpful for the school we had free hands to create a prototype of an app that we thought could be useful. Even though it wouldn't be related to the school.</p>
